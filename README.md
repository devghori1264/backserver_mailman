## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation and configuration of Mailman, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Ruby**: Mailman requires Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher. You can install Ruby using your preferred package manager or by downloading it from the official Ruby website.
- **Rails**: Mailman is built on the Ruby on Rails framework. Ensure you have Rails installed on your system by running `gem install rails`.
- **Database**: Mailman supports various database systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. Choose the database system that best suits your requirements and ensure it is installed and configured correctly.
- **SMTP Server**: Mailman relies on an SMTP server for sending outgoing emails. Configure your preferred SMTP server settings in the application configuration file.

## Installation

To install Mailman on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Mailman repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devghori1264/backserver_mailman.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
bundle install
```

3. **Database Setup**: Create and migrate the database by running the following commands:

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

4. **Start the Server**: Start the Rails server by running:

```bash
rails server
```

Once the server is running, you can access Mailman by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Configuration

Before deploying Mailman in a production environment, ensure you configure the following settings:

- **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables for sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and SMTP server settings. Store these variables securely and avoid hardcoding them in configuration files.
- **Email Configuration**: Configure the `config/environments/production.rb` file with the appropriate SMTP server settings for sending outgoing emails. Ensure TLS encryption and authentication mechanisms are enabled for secure communication.
- **Domain Whitelisting**: If using Mailman with chatbots or third-party integrations, whitelist the domains of authorized services to prevent unauthorized access to the application.

## Usage

Using Mailman is straightforward and intuitive. Here's a brief overview of the basic usage workflow:

1. **Customer Inquiry**: When a customer submits an inquiry via email or chat, Mailman receives the message and analyzes its contents using natural language processing algorithms.
2. **Response Generation**: Based on the analysis of the customer inquiry, Mailman generates a personalized response using predefined response templates or custom logic defined by administrators.
3. **Delivery**: Once the response is generated, Mailman delivers it to the customer via the appropriate communication channel, whether it's email, chat, or another platform.
4. **Feedback and Analytics**: Mailman collects feedback from customers regarding the effectiveness of the response and provides administrators with analytics and insights to track performance metrics.

## Customization

Mailman offers extensive customization options to tailor the application to your specific requirements:

- **Response Templates**: Customize response templates to reflect your brand voice and ensure consistency in communication with customers.
- **Integration with AI Services**: Integrate Mailman with AI services such as IBM Watson or Google Cloud Natural Language Processing to enhance response generation capabilities.
- **UI Customization**: Modify the user interface to match your branding guidelines and provide a seamless user experience for customers and administrators alike.
